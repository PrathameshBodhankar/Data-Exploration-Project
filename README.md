Zomato Sales and Delivery Data Exploration

Project Overview

This project involves exploring and analyzing Zomato's sales and delivery data using two datasets:

Delivery Ratings Dataset: Contains information about delivery ratings for various countries.

Country Information Dataset: Includes general country details to provide additional context.

The primary goal is to uncover insights into delivery performance, identify trends, and understand how country-specific attributes impact delivery ratings.

Datasets

1. Delivery Ratings Dataset

Filename: delivery_ratings.csv

Key Columns:

Restaurant Name: Name of the restaurant.

Country Code: Identifier for the country.

Delivery Rating: Average delivery rating for the restaurant.

Number of Ratings: Total number of ratings received for deliveries.

Delivery Time: Average delivery time (in minutes).

2. Country Information Dataset

Filename: country_info.csv

Key Columns:

Country Code: Identifier for the country (matches with delivery_ratings.csv).

Country Name: Full name of the country.

Population: Population of the country.

Region: Geographical region of the country.

Key Objectives

Merge the datasets to create a comprehensive view of delivery performance by country.

Analyze trends in delivery ratings across different countries and regions.

Identify correlations between delivery ratings, delivery times, and country-specific attributes such as population or region.

Generate visualizations to highlight key insights.

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites

Python 3.7+

Required libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

jupyterlab (optional, for interactive exploration)

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zomato-data-exploration.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd zomato-data-exploration

Install required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Code

Launch a Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Open data_exploration.ipynb for step-by-step analysis.

Project Workflow

Step 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing

Load delivery_ratings.csv and country_info.csv into pandas DataFrames.

Clean missing or inconsistent data.

Merge the datasets on Country Code to create a unified DataFrame.

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate Analysis:

Distribution of delivery ratings.

Top countries by average delivery rating.

Bivariate Analysis:

Relationship between delivery time and delivery ratings.

Impact of population on delivery ratings.

Regional Analysis:

Compare delivery performance across regions.

Step 3: Visualization

Use matplotlib and seaborn to create:

Histograms and box plots for rating distributions.

Heatmaps to show correlations between variables.

Bar plots to highlight country-wise and regional trends.

Step 4: Insights and Recommendations

Summarize findings from the analysis.

Provide actionable recommendations for improving delivery ratings.


Future Work

Incorporate additional datasets such as restaurant menu details or customer demographics.

Use machine learning models to predict delivery ratings.

Conduct sentiment analysis on customer reviews (if available).
